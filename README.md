A simple Java console application to manage students' data 📚.  
Built during a bootcamp to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts, logic building, and good development practices.

📚 What I Practiced Here
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

✅ Creating and managing ArrayList of custom objects

✅ Using Scanner to take user input

✅ Implementing loops (do-while, for-each)

✅ Applying try-catch for input validation

✅ Creating and using custom methods

✅ Organizing logic across multiple classes

✅ Console formatting with emojis for better readability

✅ Strengthening logical thinking and clean code habits 🧹

🧠 Why I Built This project was born during my bootcamp journey 💪✨.
I wanted a real, hands-on way to apply everything I was learning in Java:
from creating classes, managing objects, to validating input and working with collections.

It helped me:

- Reinforce my understanding of object-oriented thinking 🧱

- Build confidence writing structured programs 🛠

- Have a fun and visual way to interact with what I built 🌈

- Keep motivated seeing my progress every day 🚀

To showcase my programming skills in order to have a solid base, for opportunities.
